Matbox is a streamlined solution for managing MATLAB toolbox development, designed to simplify the entire lifecycle—from code checks and dependency management to cleaning, packaging, and continuous integration. With Matbox, you can automate tedious tasks like verifying code quality, handling external dependencies, ensuring compatibility, and bundling your toolbox for distribution.

To get started, use the [template repository](https://github.com/ehennestad/Matlab-Toolbox)

## Key Features:

- **Automated Dependency Management**: Streamline your project setup with automatic installation and configuration of required packages.
- **Code Quality Assurance**: Perform code checks and maintain clean, consistent codebases with linting and format enforcement.
- **Continuous Integration**: Seamlessly integrate CI/CD pipelines to ensure code stability and easy deployment.
- **Effortless Packaging**: Package your MATLAB toolbox for easy distribution with minimal configuration.

Whether you are building your first toolbox or maintaining a complex library, Matbox helps you stay organized, efficient, and focused on writing great code.

## Requirements
It is recommended to use MATLAB R2023a or later. Toolbox packaging will only work with R2023 or later, other functionality of the toolbox should work with older releases as well.
